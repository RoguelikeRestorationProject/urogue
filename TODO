add_pack() calls ur_free() on the linked list pointer passed
to it. Need to go through code and look for cases where we

Bug in genocide scroll: don't request list, type letter, etc...

Implement potion of true sight.

Bug: apparently when creating a new familiar after a player level
change, something isn't begin reset because ur SEGVs when running
through the monster list in do_chase() right after the new
familiar is created. It appears that the familiar isn't being removed
from the monster list.
