UltraRogue: The Ultimate Adventure in the Dungeons of Doom

There are 8 different treasures to be picked up in this version of rogue.
The first is on level 25 and is relatively easy to pick up.  The last is
on level 100 and is very difficult to get.  Carrying any one of the
unique treasures allows the rogue to go up the stairs, but one has to
be very careful.  To be a total winner, yu must pick up all 8 and
return to the surface again.

(note: the above may be incorrect, i think the number of levels is
reduced to 50 and you have to get all 8 artifacts to go back up)

The environment variable UROGUE is used to set up the default things
for a player.  The options that can be set are:

terse:		short output messages
flush:		flush typeahead when fighting
jump:		show position only at the end of running
inven:		inventory style
askme:		ask about unidentified things
stopdoor:       stop running when next to something interesting
name:		the rogue's name (string)
fruit:		the funny fruit used by the rogue (string)
file:		default savefile name (string)
score:		default scorefile name (string)
class:		default player class (string)

Something like

setenv UROGUE "name=George of the Jungle,fruit=peach,noterse,jump"

does the obvious.  The "score" option is ignored unless you start
urogue in wizard mode.  The class option string can have the following
values: "fighter", "illus", "paladin", "ranger", "cleric", "magic",
"assasin", "druid", "ninja", and "thief" and is initialized only at
startup time.  The "inven" option can take the values "slow", "clear",
and "overwrite".

Acknowledgements
================

The source code for Rogue 3.6 (by Michael Toy, Ken Arnold and Glenn 
Wichman) was used as the original basis for this game. A thousand 
thanks go out to them and their classic adventure game of the early 1980s.

Modifications of a long forgotten and bastardized nature were taken
from Advanced Rogue 1.0 and/or SuperRogue. We believe that the flea market, 
pools, and maze levels had their origin somewhere around here.
